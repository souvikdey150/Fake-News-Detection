# Fake-News-Detection
Machine Learning and natural language processing (NLP) are used
for various purposes, including the detection of fake news. The
classifiers are first trained with a data set called the training data
set. After that, these classifiers can automatically detect fake news.
The algorithms used to implement the model are Logistic
Regression, RandomForestClassifier, PassiveAggressiveClassifier
and DecisionTreeClassifier.
